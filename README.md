**Problem Statement**
Our motivation for creating the app was to overcome the difficulties people encounter in interior decoration. We aimed to provide a user-friendly platform where individuals can easily select furniture and decorative items according to their preferences. By offering a seamless virtual design experience, we sought to save users both time and money. Our goal was to empower users to create their dream living spaces with convenience and ease.

**Scope**
The software aims to deliver users with a virtual reality experience, so that they can decide what would go best with the room before buying the thing. 

**User Interface**
The user interface is created with the aim of giving the users a simple and easy to use interface that navigates users to the module of their choice with the least amount of hassle. So, on entering the home page itself, users can see a catalogue window which consists of shoppable products option in it. There is also a cart option where users can once again check the product they have added in the list, order the products.
